Pre-clinical data was suggestive of a teratogenic effect of eribulin mesylate. Pertuzumab caused oligohydramnios, delayed renal development and embryo-fetal deaths in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys. In the post-marketing setting, cases of oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia of the fetus have been reported in pregnant women receiving trastuzumab. For these reasons women of child bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\nAbility to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document (approved by Institutional review board or independent ethics committee) obtained prior to any study procedure, with the understanding that the subject may withdraw at any time without prejudice.\nLaboratory tests required for eligibility must be completed within 14 days prior study entry. Baseline tumor measurements must be documented from tests within 28 days of study entry. Other non-laboratory tests must be performed within 28 days of study entry.\nFor the Phase 2 portion of the study; patients must have tissue that is amenable to biopsy and must be willing to undergo research biopsy.\n\nExclusion Criteria: - Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible for admission into the study:\n\nParticipants receiving any other study agents.\nParticipants receiving any other cancer directed concurrent therapy; such as concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or hormonal therapy. Concurrent treatment with biphosphonates/denosumab is allowed but should be started before starting treatment on study.\nActive brain metastases: Participants with previously diagnosed brain metastases are eligible if they have completed treatment at least one month prior to enrollment, are neurologically stable, and have recovery from effects of radiotherapy or surgery.\nHistory of allergic reaction attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to eribulin mesylate, trastuzumab or pertuzumab, which cannot be managed by premedication.\nParticipants who previously received eribulin mesylate are not eligible for enrollment on the phase II portion.\nPrior chemotherapy, targeted therapy, hormonal therapy, or radiation therapy (including any investigational agents) within 2 weeks prior entering the study or those who have not recovered adequately from adverse events (AEs) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier (excluding alopecia and hot flashes). A washout period is not necessary for trastuzumab (or pertuzumab for run-in patients when applicable).\nA baseline corrected QT interval of > 470 ms.\nPre-existing neuropathy \u201a\u00e2\u2022 grade 2 (NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0)\nUncontrolled intercurrent illness including, not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or other significant diseases or disorders that, in the investigator's opinion, would exclude the subject from participating in the study\nSymptomatic intrinsic lung disease or extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in grade 2 or higher dyspnea at rest.\nCurrently pregnant or breast-feeding. All females must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of \u0152\u2264-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (\u0152\u2264-Hcg) at the Baseline visit [within 7 days of the first dose of study treatment]). Females of childbearing potential must agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception (e.g., abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double-barrier method such as condom + spermicidal or condom + diaphragm with spermicidal, a contraceptive implant, an oral contraceptive or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after discontinuation of study treatment. The only subjects who will be exempt from this requirement are postmenopausal women (defined as women who have been amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age group, without other known or suspected primary cause) or subjects who have been sterilized surgically or who are otherwise proven sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation with surgery at least 1 month before start of study treatment, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy with surgery at least 1 month before start of study treatment). Current, ongoing protocols containing pertuzumab have included continuous pregnancy monitoring during the trial and for six months after the last dose of study drug is administered. Because of the long half-life of pertuzumab, women should be warned not to become pregnant for at least six months after completion of treatment.\nIndividuals with a history of different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ, and non-melanoma cancer of the skin.",

Current, ongoing protocols containing pertuzumab have included continuous pregnancy monitoring during the trial and for six months after the last dose of study drug is administered. Because of the long half-life of pertuzumab, women should be warned not to become pregnant for at least six months after completion of treatment. Individuals with a history of different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ, and non-melanoma cancer of the skin."
